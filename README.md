# Data-Vis-Group-Project
This project asks the question: what choices can chess players make to maximize their chance to win a chess game? 

To answer this question, we designed a data visualization that would allow users to study various opening chess moves and see likelihood of winning with respect to factors such as ELO (Player) ratings, chess color and win percentages.

The chess data was collected from over 20,000 chess games from LiChess, source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess
